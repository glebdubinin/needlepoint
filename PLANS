## Location Types:

- Building
  - House
    - 0-5 undead, decent loot
  - Apartment
    - 0-2 undead, not great loot
  - Supermarket
    - 10-80 undead, alarms, tons of food and menial early-game supplies
  - Small Shop
    - 2-10 undead, alarms, very good loot but category-limited to the shop's nature
  - Church
    - Always spawn with 0 undead, but no effective loot. Can be used as storage locations.
  - School
    - Expansive, large multi-building areas with 200-3000 undead in total. Mostly low-level, and little effective loot. Good area for training combat skill.
  - Gym
    - 20-50 relatively dangerous undead. Can be used to train strength skill when cleared.
  - Bar
    - 10-30 undead. Little loot except alcohol (Boosts morale (morale acts as a secondary type of armour) and impairs skills that require any kind of coordination)
  - Hospital
    - 80-300 undead. Good health-based loot, most undead are extremely weak, every once in a while they're exceptionally strong.
  - Warehouse
- Vehicle
  - Car
  - Van
  - Trailer
  - Motorbike
- Street
  - Trail
    - Footpaths in the middle of forests and parks; barely safe enough for a motorbike
  - Track
    - Car-width path in forests. Not always safe.
  - Narrow Alley
    - the smallest side alleys, containing nothing but undead, rubbish and other small misc objects.
  - Side Street
    - Barely wide enough to fit a car; driving one through here, even if it's safe, very well might damage it.
  - Street
    - Can fit cars in two directions, with footpaths on either side. Usually houses the main entrances to buildings, and typically not the safest place if it hasn't been cleared.
  - Road
    - Typically multi-lane, has some buildings on the sides, but sparsely. Not too dangerous, if there aren't carwrecks.
  - Highway
    - Empty connectors between towns and cities.
- Park
  - Mini-forests that used to be housed and taken care of. Now they're extremely dangerous places.
- Wilderness
  - Pointless to enter. Unbelievably expansive. Extremely dangerous. 
- Sewer
  - Initially dangerous, but once they're cleared, become a useful method of transport.
- Subway
  - dunno how im gonna handle these


## Other misc things to make:
- make a system taht can read and parse the gamestate saved in the form of csv files
- seed-based procedural world generation?
- Make a region category "temperature" value for different places, to simulate the formation of "biomes," to ensure you don't have power plants and warehouses forming right next to bars and individual houses
