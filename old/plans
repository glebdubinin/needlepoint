### other random notes


maybe you could make an engine to tell apart similar words and terms by splitting the strings
of words of what someone put as their command and comparing it to other things that 
could've been said considering the context, and comparing how many items in that list
of letters varies between the two variations of objects?

### things left to make
- make a system that can read and parse the gamestate saved in the form of csv files
- make an engine to generate gamestates and save files randomly, after you've developed the variations of rooms n things
